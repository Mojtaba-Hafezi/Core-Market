This is an Implementation of Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core 8 WebApi. With this Open-Source BoilerPlate Template, you will get access to the world of Loosely-Coupled and Inverted-Dependency Architecture in ASP.NET Core 8 WebApi.
For Adding Your Connection String (in Development phase) please add a user-sercret file with visual-studio and locate your connection string there. If you put "CoreMarketConnection" as the key for connection string you don't need to change it in several places in the app because i used that in application code.
Then in PMC (package manager console) use command: database-update to apply the migrations and seeding the initial data in the database.
There is an SQL Server Database Project that named 'CoreMarketProject'. Please publish it to the database that is created by migrations. Because endpoint 'GetDeletedProductCount' is using a stored procedure inside of this project. This endpoint gives you the number of soft-deleted products.
